Your job is to summarize a meeting transcript. It should be summarized at a high level in a few sentences. You should both summarize the content, but also the tone and remaining open questions/uncertainties from the meeting (if any exist).

Please keep your summary around 2-3 sentances max, and your words short and concise.
