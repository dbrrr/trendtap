{:actors #{"Rut Gjefsen" "Bob Loblaw"}, :transcript "Bob Loblaw: Hey Rut, thanks for meeting today. I wanted to discuss the crosswords we had in the last issue.\nRut Gjefsen: Oh yes, I remember those crosswords. I have to say, I wasn't a fan.\nBob Loblaw: Really? I actually quite liked them. I thought they added a fun element to the magazine.\nRut Gjefsen: Hmm, I see your point. But I felt they were a bit too challenging. Our readers might have struggled with them.\nBob Loblaw: That's interesting. I thought the level of difficulty was just right. Maybe we could consider including more hints next time.\nRut Gjefsen: I suppose that could help. But overall, I'm not convinced they're the best fit for our audience.\nBob Loblaw: Fair enough. Maybe we could do a reader survey to get some feedback on the crosswords.\nRut Gjefsen: That's a good idea. It would give us a better understanding of what our readers actually think.\nBob Loblaw: Exactly. And then we can make an informed decision on whether to continue including them in the magazine.\n"}
