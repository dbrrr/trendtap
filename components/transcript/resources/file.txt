{:actors #{nil}, :transcript "null: Hey everyone, thanks for joining. I wanted to discuss our travel plans for the upcoming trip to Tanzania.\nnull: Um, actually David, I was thinking, what if we consider going to Ghana instead? I heard there's so much culture and history there.\nnull: Ah, I see where you're coming from Rut. Ghana does sound interesting, but I had my heart set on visiting the NgoroNgoro Crater in Tanzania.\nnull: Yeah, I get that. But maybe we can explore both options and see which one aligns better with our goals for this trip.\nnull: That's a fair point. I suppose we could compare the attractions, activities, and logistics of both destinations before making a final decision.\nnull: Exactly, we want to make sure we make the most of this trip and that it's a memorable experience for all of us.\nnull: I completely agree. It's important that we consider everyone's preferences and expectations when choosing our destination.\nnull: Definitely. So, how about we each do some research on both destinations and reconvene next week to discuss our findings?\nnull: Sounds like a plan. Let's gather all the information we need and make an informed decision together.\n"}
